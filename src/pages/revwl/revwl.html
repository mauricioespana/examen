        <p>One of the Foo Fighers GREATEST albums of all times. Crisp and clear, the sound is heavy, loud and meant to be played a STUPID levels. If your neighbors don't like the Foo Fighters, they will after you play it for them a hundred times.</p>
        <p>Only gripe is the most minor of gripes, but having the album be a 45rpm speed means they can only fit 2-3 songs on each side of the record...So get ready to be flipping constantly.</p>

    <p>Wasting Light does not mince words - it's punchy, crisp, and feels like an amalgamation of everything they've done in the past. It features rockers, ballads, and even the grunge-metal of their self-titled debut, all packed onto one disc. You could consider it a primer for all things Foo, and in an odd way it even makes a better "greatest hits" than their actual Greatest Hits.</p>
    <p>The album's strongest quality is that familiarity - the Foo Fighters always sound like themselves, and they'll never throw you for a loop. Some may fight me over this actually being a bad thing, but it actually makes them one of the most reliable rock bands around these days. And while Wasting Light fits that bill perfectly - familiarly Foo - something about it feels re-energized. Maybe it was their hiatus, or recording the album in a garage, or even the reunion with Butch Vig, Pat Smear, and Krist Novoselic. But whatever it is, the album packs a wallop and a consistency that hasn't been seen since The Colour and the Shape. "Bridge Burning" is energetic, heavy, and catchy, "Arlandria" starts off with a riff that could've been on Them Crooked Vultures' album, and "These Days" has Grohl spitting venom. A few tracks near the end blend together and are fairly forgettable ("A Matter of Time", "Miss the Misery"), but even then, they're not bad. Which is something I've thought about the Foos for a long time now - even at their worst, they're still the best.</p>

      <p>I'm a huge Foo fan and I'm not afraid to express my opinion if their music doesn't live up to expectations. This album is probably my favorite to date and that's after their Sonic Highways and Saint Cecilia releases. This album is both complex and fun, and I've gone weeks listening to this album and nothing else without getting tired. IMO I think this album shows the band's development as song writers and musicians and it just an overall good listen.</p>
