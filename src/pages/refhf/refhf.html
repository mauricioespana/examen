          <p>Hot Fuss is a hell of a record. The first 5 tracks off this sensational debut effort could easily be five tracks of a greatest hits album. This CD pretty much epitomizes the new wave rock of 2004. A perfect blend of synth pop, indie rock, glam, and dance all rolled up into one. This is most definitely one of the best albums of the 2000's. There isn't a bad track, in my opinion, and it's one of those rare gems where you can play the entire album from front to back without just having a couple decent tracks to repeat. My favorite tracks are Jennie Was a Friend of Mine and All These Things I've Done, but I thoroughly enjoy all the others as well. Not just an incredible debut album, but a solid, top notch one in general. 5/5 stars</p>

      <p>This is a very good album that most will enjoy, I have always been a fan of the killers this is the best album in my opinion. The following is based on sound quality and not the music itself. I am a light audiophile and I have to say this cd should only be played in car or speakers. In general this album is VERY loud. But I'm referring to how the loudness drowns everything out. No instrument separation and poor soundstage. The sound quality is muddy and compressed I listen to the FLAC file on my Dt 990s and could hardly bare to listen. Do not buy for headphones if you own a decent pair. They need a complete overhaul remaster. But like I said this does not ruin the album as a whole.</p>

        <p>When I first bought this album, I loved it. I still like it, but compared to bands like Interpol, Franz Ferdinand, the Bravery, Radiohead, the Cure etc., the material comes up somewhat short.</p>
        <p>This is still a really good album. It sounds a bit like a cross between the Cars and the Cure. The songwriting is simple, not the least bit genius. It is a catchy sounding album with good melodies. Its not strong or overly well-written, but it is still worth checking out.</p>
        <p>I still find it refreshing to listen to, among anything else on mainstream radio. I am glad to see the new wave style music come back into favor. I think I liked the Killers before they became so popular, and now they seem to mainstream to me. If you like new wave/ 80's inspired pop, you will like this album a lot. I feel it is still worth purchasing and adding to your music collection.</p>
        <p>My favorite songs on this album are Jenny was a Friend of Mine, Mr. Brightside, Smile Like you Mean it, Somebody Told me, and Midnight Show. Jenny was Friend of Mine and Midnight Show are dark, about the murder of a girlfriend. Somebody Told Me is about sexual ambigiouty. All and in all the songs are melodic and easy to listen too.</p>
