          <p>The Arctic Monkeys delivered an audacious and brash debut, actually bearing up to their hype when hit American shores. It was low-fi teenage rock and sounded it, but the sheer manic thrill carried the album. But now that they are stars, that low-key charm is was what many were looking for in the follow-up.</p>
          <p>"Favourite Worst Nightmare" is basically, a more mature version of the debut, produced more cleanly, with stronger recording skills and a better budget, by a band that is road-tested and better because of it. "Brainstorm" is the kind of jagged guitar pop-rock that you would expect, and sounds as good as anything on the debut. The almost funky "Fluorescent Adolescent," about a former party girl who is dealing with growing up. The album zips by at a breath-taking 37 minutes, fast enough that the generally repetitive nature of the remaining songs might not wear you down.</p>
          <p>The songs are still rocking and will get you pumped. Just that, strung together, the effect can become tiring. Arctic Monkeys can blast out zingers like "Old Yellow Brick" and "505," but there isn't any sign of artistic progress here. I'd even go as far as to say that "Favourite Worst Nightmare" could even be a better album than the debut in terms of consistently and craft, but misses the thrill of discovery and the adrenal rush of kids discovering rock. Like sophomore efforts from or , they may find themselves melting away from the spotlight sooner than they deserve to.</p>

      <p>This was my first experience with Arctic Monkeys outside of hearing them on Pandora. This is a well put together album. Every song is good and it flows very well all the way to the more laid back vibe of 505. I had just gone to the beach before purchasing this album and it always remind me of the beach because there are surfer vibes. It is by no means surfer rock but it just has some of those sounds. I look forward to experiencing other albums by this group.</p>

        <p>This is by far my favorite arctic monkeys album and hearing it on vinyl just makes the listening experience even better. I definitely recommend adding this to your collection</p>
