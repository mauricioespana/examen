  <p>Foo Fighters came about due to tragic circumstances. After the suicide of Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain in 1994 and the band's subsequent dissolution, drummer Dave Grohl decided to focus on recording a collection of songs he'd been developing for a few years. Handling all the vocals and almost all the instruments himself, Grohl called his 1995 debut Foo Fighters, which was also the name of his new band, a reference to World War II terminology for unidentified flying objects.</p>
  <p>The album showcased Grohl's melodic rock songs indebted to hard rock and punk, establishing the band's musical blueprint.</p>
  <p>When it came time to hit the road to support Foo Fighters, Grohl recruited two former members of the alternative-rock group Sunny Day Real Estate -- drummer William Goldsmith and bassist Nate Mendel -- as well as guitarist Pat Smear, who had been a part of Nirvana for that band's final tour. Foo Fighters were a full-fledged band now, but its lineup was about to go through a series of changes.</p>
