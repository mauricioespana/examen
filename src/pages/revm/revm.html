      <p>"Origin of Symmetry" by Muse took me a few listens to see how fun and experimental this album really is. This album was released in 2001 and this is Muse's sophomore effort. I don't have their debut album yet so I can't say if "Origin of Symmetry" is stronger or weaker than "Showbiz". This album is very different than the ones that follow this like "Absolution" and "Black Holes and Revelations". This record is slightly lo-fi and more alternative rock-sounding. It's not as glossy and some of the melodies/arrangements are simplistic and laid-back. But there's a handful of radio-friendly juggernauts like the synth/pop gem, "Bliss", the catchy, blistering brilliance of "Darkshines" (my personal favorite), and "Plug in Baby" which has the best guitar riff I've ever heard. Songs like "Megalomania" and "Screenager" show the band's softer side, and in "Micro Cuts" you hear Matthew Bellamy singing through a megaphone, musically it's the strongest track. "Hyper Music" is snarky and lively. Definitely lives up to its title. "New Born", "Space Dementia" (Bellamy is classically trained on the piano), and "Citizen Erased" are the real powerhouses. Very experimental and have multi-layered arrangements and gorgeous melodies. There's a cover of the jazz standard, "Feeling Good" which seems like an odd choice for the band to cover, but somehow it works. Bellamy turns the song on its head, and his vocals are buttery soft and show the power of his range (that falsetto, wow). Like I said, you probably won't enjoy this album on first listen. It took until the 4th listen for the songs to become familiar and reveal itself to me. Muse is one of my favorite bands. They always surprise me and never disappoint me. Enjoy! </p>

      <p>I love Muse, but had to order Origin of Symmetry to complete my collection. This early album has intensity, relevance, passion, and even humor in its trademark darkness. The cover "Feeling Good" is a refreshing trip into a theatrical classic. "Citizen Erased" was just classified by NME as one of 50 rock songs that qualify as giving the listener goosebumps. The whole album is an anthem to Muse's signature sound. I am so glad I ordered it, and I have listened to it every day for a month.</p>

      <p>Like a lot of people here in the US, I first learned of this band thanks to Stephenie Meyer, who mentioned Muse in the acknowledgements of her Twilight novels. Curious, I looked them up on Wikipedia, then immediately headed over to Amazon.com to hear what I could of their music. I first bought Showbiz, which I absolutely loved. Then came this, its followup, Origin of Symmetry. In fact I own all of their studio albums except their newest one (which I do intend to get at some point), as well as their CD/DVD combo HAARP. Origins is just as solid as Showbiz was and, in many ways, even more so. Whereas the opening track of Showbiz, Sunburn, opened with a neat piano arpeggio, New Born, Origins' opener, opens with a hauntingly beautiful piano riff and then quickly builds into a pounding rocker with some of the coolest lyrics ever. The second track. Bliss, is the other of my two favorites. It also opens with a dreamy keyboard before quickly picking up. The rest of the tracks, while in no way forgettable, haven't yet caught my attention the way the first two did. But they're definitely still worth listening and there aren't any that I skip.</p>
