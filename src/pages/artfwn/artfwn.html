  <p>The Indie rock/ neo-punk band Arctic Monkeys can be categorized in the same circles as other global multi-platinum acts such as Pink Floyd and Oasis. Sheffield’s Arctic Monkeys rose to become one of the most popular and biggest bands of the new millennium from just a single self-released EP back in 2005.</p>
  <p>The band’s meteoric rise to international fame scored the band a series of achievements very early on in their careers, which helped to position them to the top position of the international singles chart.</p>
  <p>When the group was just starting out, the fans helped to spread Arctic Monkeys’ demo songs through various online message boards. This led to a growing loyal fan base. Arctic’s monkey remarkable rise as the indie band to watch out for could never have happened without their extraordinary fan base and the viral buzz of the internet. From this extempore beginning, Arctic Monkey would go on to create one of the fastest selling debut albums that the UK has ever seen.</p>
  <p>Although the UK has definitely introduced formidable acts to the global arena such as The Bee Gees, Deep Purple, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, and David Bowie, not many attained success quite as rapidly as Arctic Monkeys. Not bad at all for a group that was formed by for suburban friends after high school. Today, Arctic Monkeys is still one of the bestselling rock bands of this century and definitely one of the UK’s finest.</p>
